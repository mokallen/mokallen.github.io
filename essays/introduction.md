I decided to major in MIS because I value working in a people-oriented environment in addition to learning high technical skills. MIS is the study of technology, people, organizations, and the relationships among them. It is an integrative field that develops the communication bridge between the worlds of business and technology. I was previously a computer science student, but I quickly found that I was much more interested in learning how to use programs to solve problems rather than developing them from scratch. While I would have never imagined myself to be a business student, I’ve really enjoyed the experiences I’ve had and find that it suits me better!

From a young age, I have always been very involved with technology because I was an avid video game player. I allotted a lot of my free time to watching videos on jailbreaking and file corruption to mod my Sims and Nintendo games. I enjoy this major because my hobbies and passions are greatly aligned with the content I learn, and I know that the skills I will gain can be used in various fields. With a degree in MIS, I hope to be qualified to work in many different industries and expand my expertise. However, my ultimate career goal would be to break into the Esports industry and work for one of my favorite gaming companies. As the world becomes more dependent on technology, the need for information systems will grow. I felt that by studying MIS, I will not only find rapid job growth, but also many career possibilities.
